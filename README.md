=================

Naive way to detect salient (unknown) objects based SURF features and face detection algorithms.

Requires Opencv 2.x, NumPy and SciPy libraries.

salient_demo.py script will outline salient objects by green circle
gravity_demo.py script will zoom-out (if necessary) and cut salient object in a cirle of 160px radius. Results will be compared to gravity screenshots.
